## Chapter 1 | 5 Ws & How?
[Daniel Goleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Goleman) articulated the concept of **emotional intelligence** in his 1995 book, ["Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ."](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X). 

Emotional intelligence is an empathic ability to perceive, manage, adapt, and regulate emotions. You need to recognize, differentiate, and identify your and others' feelings, thoughts and attitudes.

> "People often try to regulate their emotions when they believe that they are unhelpful" - [James Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gross)

Studies have shown people with high emotional intelligence also have

* Better mental health
    > **Mental health** includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
* Great leadership skills
    >* Decisiveness. 
    >* Integrity. 
    >* Relationship building (or team building)
    >* Problem-solving. 
    >* Dependability. 
    >* Ability to teach and mentor.
* Tend to have stronger relationships
    >* **Family relations** and relatives: consanguinity
    >* **Interpersonal relationship**, a strong, deep, or close association or acquaintance between two or more people
    >* **Romance** (love), a connection between two people driven by love and/or sexual attraction
* Perform well in the job, especially where interpersonal interaction is required
    >* **verbal** (speaking face to face), 
    >* **written** (in a chat or an email, for example) 
    >* **non-verbal** (for instance facial expressions and body language).

Goldman model to measure emotional intelligence. 
* Self-awareness - understand your own emotions (strengths and weaknesses)
* Self-regulation - channel your disruptive emotions and tendencies and adapt to changing social environment
* Social skill - managing relationships and influencing people
* Empathy - considerate of other people's feelings, make decisions to accommodate them
    > **Empathy** is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.
* Motivation - motivation to be driven to certain goals
    > Later learned it meant controlling your emotions with a logical mind, ex: if you hear a loud bang and become scared, try not to be. People that have been lobotomized - connections between the left and the right brain side have been severed, cannot do this.
> In 2000, Goleman developed this model further in his book [Working with Emotional Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Emotional-Intelligence-Daniel-Goleman/dp/0553378589)
> * Self-awareness - know your emotions
> * Self-management - manage your emotions & motivate yourself
> * Social awareness - recognize & understand other people's emotions
> * Relationship management - manage relationships (others' emotions)
## Chapter 2 | Impulse
Most of the bad decisions that we make result from emotional considerations instead of logical conclusions. Ex: you eat junk food based on how it makes you feel.
> I would rather rephrase it as "Know what **tires you out** (not just physically)"
1) Identify your emotional weaknesses. 
    - When do you start doing something less meaningful? 
    - What feeling is driving me to avoid the correct cause of action?
2) Knowing your triggers. (postmortem of bad calls)
    - Find the one thing that precipitates that action
    - Can strategize how to improve in future
